Timings Board Project

Overview

The Timings Board project is a Python program designed to analyze lap time data for Formula 1 drivers and display their performance metrics during practice sessions. It processes input files generated by the timing system and provides valuable insights about driversâ€™ performance, including fastest laps, average times, and more.

Features

Command-Line Interface:
Accepts input file paths as command-line arguments.
Handles errors gracefully for missing or invalid files.

Lap Time Analysis:
Processes lap time data to calculate the fastest lap for each driver.
Computes average lap times and total laps completed by each driver.
Identifies the driver with the overall fastest lap.

Driver Details Integration:
Reads additional driver details (e.g., full name, team name, car number) from a separate file.
Displays enhanced race statistics with these details.

Race Results Display:
Displays race results in a tabular format using the tabulate library.
Outputs the fastest lap times in descending order.
Allows users to view detailed statistics for individual drivers.

Data Visualization:
Generates graphs of lap times for individual drivers using matplotlib.
Highlights fastest and average lap times on the graph.

CSV Output:
Saves detailed race results to a CSV file, including race title and driver statistics.

Error Handling:
Handles file-related errors, missing driver codes, and invalid inputs gracefully.

Support for Multiple Races:

Processes multiple race files and maps results to unique CSV files.
