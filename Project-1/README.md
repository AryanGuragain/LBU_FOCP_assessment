<h1><b>Project 1- A Timings Board</b></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The Timings Board project is a Python program designed to analyze lap time data for Formula 1 drivers and display their performance metrics during practice sessions. It processes input files generated by the timing system and provides valuable insights about drivers’ performance, including fastest laps, average times, and more.

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Command-Line Interface:</h3>
Accepts input file paths as command-line arguments.
Handles errors gracefully for missing or invalid files.

<h3>Lap Time Analysis:</h3>
Processes lap time data to calculate the fastest lap for each driver.
Computes average lap times and total laps completed by each driver.
Identifies the driver with the overall fastest lap.

<h3>Driver Details Integration:</h3>
Reads additional driver details (e.g., full name, team name, car number) from a separate file.
Displays enhanced race statistics with these details.

<h3>Race Results Display:</h3>
Displays race results in a tabular format using the tabulate library.
Outputs the fastest lap times in descending order.
Allows users to view detailed statistics for individual drivers.

<h3>Data Visualization:</h3>
Generates graphs of lap times for individual drivers using matplotlib.
Highlights fastest and average lap times on the graph.

<h3>CSV Output:</h3>
Saves detailed race results to a CSV file, including race title and driver statistics.

<h3>Error Handling:</h3>
Handles file-related errors, missing driver codes, and invalid inputs gracefully.

<h3>Support for Multiple Races:</h3>
Processes multiple race files and maps results to unique CSV files.

<h2>Running the Program</h2>
The program should be run from the command line<br><br>
<code>python timing_board.py drivers.txt lap_times_1.txt lap_times_2.txt lap_times_3.txt</code><br></br>
The name of the files are processed as <i>command-line arguements</i>

<h3>Viewing Driver Statistics</h3>
After processing a race file, you can input a driver’s code to view their detailed statistics.
<br><br>
Optionally, display a graph of their lap times.

<h2>Files</h2>
<code>timing_board.py</code>: Main program file.<br><br>
<code>drivers.txt</code>: Sample driver details file.<br><br>
<code>lap_times_1.txt, lap_times_2.txt, lap_times_3.txt</code>: Sample lap time files.
